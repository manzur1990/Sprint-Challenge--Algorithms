#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) 

this operation uses O(n) because of the linear execution of the code. 

b)

this operation uses O(n^2) because the nested loop; the outer llop runs 'n' times. when the inner loop comes into place it will become a quadratic function. 

c)

this operation uses O(n) becuase of its recursive nature. It does not take into acount any constant. 

## Exercise II

I would use a binary search tree where I could start in the middle floor of the building. This will allow me to drop the egg and if the result is egg_broken then whe focus on a "downard" half. repeating this will allow us to get to the point for egg_broken = False. This operation will result in O(log n)
